		<h4>Standard Light Plots</h4>
		<p>Focus Lighting Design will take a floor plan of your performance space, instrument list, and your specifications and create a standard lighting plot that you and your staff can use for a majority of your events. This is low-cost and will likely be based on the hourly pay of the designer assigned to the project. Larger spaces and more complex specifications require more skilled designers and more time. Focus Lighting Design will not supply technicians or electricians to assist you in implementing this standard plot. Should you desire both a standard plot and implementation of it, you will be charged for both a standard plot and an event implementation fee. These prices are entirely variable, and can be discussed by contacting us using the Contact page linked in the navigation bar above. Focus Lighting is not responsible for standard plots after the design has been delivered, nor will we take responsibility for incidents with instrument placement in a standard plot.</p>
