		<h4>Event Design</h4>
		<p>Focus Lighting Design offers our services for any event you might be planning in a theatrical space. Whether that means a rock concert or a church play, we are here to assist. Please note that we do not rent, sell, or purchase equipment on behalf of our clients, and that all equipment acquisition must be done through another vendor. If requested, we will rent the specified equipment through the Indianapolis Stage Equipment company, at their rates. Event design includes consultation, design proposals, implementation, and, if requested, a technician to run lighting during the event. Prices will vary depending on scale and requests. Please contact us using the Contact page.</p>
