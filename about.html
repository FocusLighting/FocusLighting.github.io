		<h4>About the Designer</h4>
		<p>Maximilian Brown has worked in the theatrical design world for the last five years, primarily at the Warren Performing Arts Center in Indianapolis. He has also worked at events such as IndyFringe in downtown Indianapolis. He has designed for musicals, ballets, and plays, including Aida (2016), Grease (2012), Our Town (2013), and The Odd Couple (2015). Furthermore, he has been hired as a lighting design consultant for numerous studios. He is currently employed at the Warren Performing Arts Center as the Assistant Technical Director, In-House Master Electrician and In-House Light Designer, where he maintains the standard light plot for the spaces and provides technical support for rental events while also teaching students at the attached Warren Central High School about lights and lighting design.</p>

		<h4>What We Do</h4>
